Yes, i know. Using toml as a database is absolutely not the best choice.
But the simplest. And b3t is all about simplicity. 
So i just left sqlite pain for future me that will work on BetterB3t.
So... you don't really need to know how it all works, but i will briefly explain:

projects.toml stores basic data about all your projects. Just name and two main paths.
projects/ directory stores all todo files of your projects.
(all tomls here named exactly as name field in their b3t.toml)
